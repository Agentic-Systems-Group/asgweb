    <h2>Focus areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NuanceBench:</strong> A benchmark emphasizing edge cases (soft policy boundaries, adversarial requests, and mis-specification) to evaluate real-world agent robustness. (Overview forthcoming.)</li>
      <li><strong>CivSim:</strong> Long-horizon, multi-agent civic simulation exploring emergent institutions, constraints, and interventions.</li>
      <li><strong>Retrieval & verification:</strong> Hybrid retrieval, structured evidence, and abstention criteria for enterprise use.</li>
    </ul>
